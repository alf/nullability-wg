Attendees:

- Alex Reilly
- Calvin Cestari
- Benjie Gillam
- Martin Bonnin

Notes:

- Previous action items:
  - Interrobang is replaced by asterisk
- Should we rename the meeting?
- Alex: Do we still need CCN?
- Benjie: ! can be done on the client side
- Benjie: ? is harder to do on the client side. True nullability helps with
  this.
- Different people wanted different things from CCN.
- Current state of true nullability is 2 proposals:
  - Strict semantic nullability using @strictNullability
  - Asterisk
- Benjie: Doing “null only on error” on a proxy/middleware could be an
  interesting project. The proxy could rewrite the introspection results as well
- Should we rename the working group? Nullability working group?
- Alex fiiles an issue to rename the working group
