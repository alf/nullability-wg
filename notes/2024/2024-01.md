Notes:

- Agenda:
  - Jordan:
    - What I learned implementing `@semanticNonNull` from Grats
    - Also wants to know about error handling feedbacks
  - Ernie:
    - Questions about the proposals
- Previous action items:
  - None
- Ernie:
  - Looking at the Apollo stuff looking at the semanticNonNull on array types
  - It looked like Grats and Apollo had implemented the directive slightly
    different from one another with regards to lists
  - Is there a discussion about which approach is better?
- Jordan:
  - There were two versions, but the array one Apollo uses is the new one, and
    the one Grats uses is the old one
  - Grats is going to switch to the Apollo syntax
  - We’re both still exploring the space, but we want to find the one the
    community is going to coalesce around
- Martin:
  - I think it’s better with the array, it’s implemented in Apollo Kotlin this
    week
  - The array syntax has an interaction with the catch directive
- Jordan:
  - Segue into semantic nullability and list items generally
  - The place where we want semantic nonnull are the places where they want the
    error handling behavior of the existing syntax (I think this is what was
    said?)
  - This doesn’t apply to array items, the executor can’t tell that an
    individual item in an array threw
- Martin:
  - There is at least one implementation where they’re doing that. It’s DGS
    (Java)
- Jordan:
  - Languages that have result types might be able to support that
- Benjie:
  - GraphQL.js operates on promises and any of them can error
  - You could be streaming results, and one of those results errors, but the
    stream continues
  - So I can think of a few cases where this is still needed in list items
- Jordan:
  - We might still need it, but it would be less common
- Martin:
  - Grats is a code-first server, given that TS has full support for
    nullability, how do you express that a field can actually be null, how do
    you express `!`
- Jordan:
  - It treats non-nullable as nullable so it can do error handling
  - You can opt back into it with a tag
  - StrictSemanticNullability option that turns it into nullable, but also adds
    @semanticNonNull
  - If you want to make it an exclamation mark, you can tag it and opt out of
    the strict semantic nullability
- Jordan:
  - I want to see what Apollo has learned during their error handling work
- Martin:
  - People like it but they want it to be part of the syntax. @semanticNonNull
    is overly verbose
  - We have a couple of teams that are doing prototypes
  - People like semanticNonNull, but catch is a little more mixed on feedback
  - If you put catch on a field, you have to put it on all fields across
    fragments
  - We also want to experiment with colocating fragments, but we haven’t started
    yet
  - It’s going to be a tough sell for Android devs because they’re into layering
- Jordan:
  - We’re working on rolling out catch and supporting it in our native clients
  - Talking with a team where there is frequently missing data, what they would
    prefer is not catch-to-error or catch-to-null
  - They want a result type always defined in the schema
  - They have also said they want to fall back to stale data
  - It’s unclear if that would be best defined at schema, component or server
    level
  - This team uses a normalized store
- Ernie:
  - It feels like the schema level is a bit heavy handed for that, needs more
    examples
- Jordan:
  - I thought you did something like that at Coinbase
- Ernie:
  - Yeah we do that, but I hadn’t tied it back to the catch directive
- Jordan:
  - One other thing we could touch on, Benjies RFC, in the interest of moving
    fast, what’s keeping us from moving forward. Anything you’re blocked on?
- Benjie:
  - The question is around syntax, and if there’s going to be this global
    directive that toggles behavior
  - I don’t think anyone’s completely happen with either solution
  - I’m going to change the syntax again
  - We’ve got a reasonably high confidence that something ~like~ this is the
    solution
- Jordan:
  - I want to collect a list of pros and cons
- Benjie:
  - Looks like it boils down to the difference between both proposals is having
    a schema directive or the `~!` (so global flag vs less usual syntax)
  - [Ideas for what the SemanticNonNull syntax could look like](<[https://gist.github.com/benjie/19d784721d1658b89fd8954e7ee07034](https://gist.github.com/benjie/19d784721d1658b89fd8954e7ee07034)>)
- Jordan:
  - Is it `user~!` or `~user!`?
  - I’ll set up some time for us to brainstorm on this.
- Benjie:
  - I think we should brainstorm, come up with the least bad syntax, and then
    put out a poll for those
- Alex:
  - What are we bringing to the WG meeting tomorrow?
- Jordan:
  - SHOULD vs MUST (note:
    [https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-HAPHRPJABABwHloX](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-HAPHRPJABABwHloX))
- Action Items:
  - Set up brainstorming session (Jordan is taking this one)
